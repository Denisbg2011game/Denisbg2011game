- 👋 Hi, you probably got here from my hacked minecraft account 'Hypipixel'
- 👀 You see, I did try to get the account back, even with a transaction ID and CC info, MS Support is really bad, the account got hacked 8+ months ago
- 🌱 I hope you spread awareness to make microsoft make its support better
- 💞️ This account is new since it is used for this now...
- 📫 https://denisland.de - info
- 📫 my new github: denisapain
- 📫 old one which had this username: oie1
